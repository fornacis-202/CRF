# Cosine Basis Functions Radiance Field
This repository contains a prototype of an ongoing project focused on novel-view synthesis using a cosine basis function network to represent volumetric radiance fields. Our approach aims to reduce the training and rendering time of traditional radiance field methods by leveraging the efficient representation of cosine basis functions (traditionally used in DCT) and closed-form volume rendering integral of cosine basis functions.
